# Crafter CMS Blueprint: Gardeners

Gardeners is a single page Crafter 3 blueprint with several information display section and great managament of images and background video. 
It's based on the Made Apps â€“ Landing Page Free Bootstrap Template by Bootstrap Themes available in https://bootstrapthemes.co/item/made-apps-landing-page-free-bootstrap-template/


# Known Issues

## Video Playback on Safari
In Safari (Chrome and Firefox work properly), videos are not displayed. This seems to occur due to lack of implementation for [206 Partial Content](https://httpstatuses.com/206) and its associated headers. However, this can be fixed by configuring another web server to serve this files statically.

### Tomcat
To do this, edit the file `apache-tomcat/conf/server.xml` and add a context like this:

    <Context docBase="../../data/repos/sites/<your-site>/sandbox/static-assets/video" path="/static-assets/video" />

You may need to tweak the docbase a bit, to begin with, replace `<your-site>` with your site's name. You may also prefer to point to `published/` instead of `sandbox/`, and for your live site, it's a different path, similar to `/opt/crafter/bin/delivery/data/deployer/deployments/<your-environment>/<your-site>/`.
More information in [Tomcat's docs](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html).

### Apache HTTP Server

You may have Apache httpd connect with Tomcat through ajp like this:

	ProxyPreserveHost ON
	ProxyPass / ajp://localhost:8009/
	ProxyPassReverse / ajp://localhost:8009/

in this case, use

	DocumentRoot "/filepath/to/crafter/site/"
	...
	ProxyPass /static-assets !

The filepath should be such that `static-assets` exists in it, like `/opt/crafter/bin/delivery/data/deployer/deployments/dev/art_showcase/` in the case of a production site (`static-assets` is in `/opt/crafter/bin/delivery/data/deployer/deployments/dev/art_showcase/static-assets/`).

Reload apache configuration with `service apache2 reload`.
